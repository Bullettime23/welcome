# Welcome!

Hello! I'm a practicing frontend developer. I master Angular framework to build web applications for enterprice. Because the development isn't an open-source I use this page to display my skills and code examples.

Feel free to discover, suggest and offer: you can contact me with <a href="mailto: letsgofrontend@gmail.com">letsgofrontend@gmail.com</a>  or https://www.linkedin.com/in/lev-medvedev/
